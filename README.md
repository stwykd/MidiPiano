# MidiPiano
This java applet that allows you to:
 - Play notes using your keyboard or midi device
 - Change among different instruments
 - Change octaves
 - Record sessions and play them back

<i>A slight annoyance: you'll need to click on the applet's panel with your mouse to give it
keyboard focus before playing any notes.</i>

You can play a set of pitches {C, C#, D, ... A#, B} using the keys {'1', '2', ... '-', '='} respectively.
The 'I' key is used to switch to the next instrument.
Pressing the 'C' and 'V' keys shifts the notes that the keys play one octave (12 semitones) down and up, respectively. You can shift by two octaves, maximum, in either direction from the starting pitches.
You can record and playback sequences of notes. When you make a new recording it replaces the previous one.
'R' toggles record mode on and off, and 'P' triggers playback.
